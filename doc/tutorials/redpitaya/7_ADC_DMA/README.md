# Red Pitaya 14-bit ADC characterization

The objective of this tutorial is to stream at full sampling rate (125 MS/s
on the 14-bit Red Pitaya) samples to the PS RAM through the DMA to collect large
enough contiguous samples to perform statistical analysis on the ADCs.

See syllabus at http://jmfriedt.free.fr/syllabus_ADC.pdf for a detailed 
description of the acquisition and processing steps.
